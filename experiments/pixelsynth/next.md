Based on the roadmap and UX analysis, here's my take on the **best path forward**:

---

**Start with: Pattern switching + Step Inspector**

Why this is the sweet spot:

1. **Minimal disruption** - Your current single-screen UI stays intact
2. **Immediate value** - Multiple patterns unlocks real song-making
3. **Foundation for everything** - Conditional triggers, p-locks, and melodic sequencing all build on this

**Concrete first steps:**

1. **Pattern bar at top** - 8 clickable slots, copy/paste, current pattern highlighted
2. **Step Inspector panel** - Click a drum step, see/edit: velocity, probability (0-100%), condition dropdown (always, 1:2, fill, etc.)
3. **One melodic track** - Add a 5th row to your drum sequencer that stores note+velocity per step (step mode, not piano roll yet)

This keeps you in "jam mode" (everything visible) while adding the core Elektron-style features that make patterns interesting.

**What to avoid for now:**

- Full piano roll (complex, needs its own view)
- Song/arrangement mode (needs patterns first)
- Mod matrix (deep rabbit hole)
- Live recording (needs melodic tracks first)

---

**TL;DR:** Add pattern slots + step probability/conditions. That's where the magic happens for both music and game audio, and it fits your current UI.

# Vision

What this game is and isn't.

---

## The Feeling

**Koyaanisqatsi** - life out of balance.

Watching systems interact. Human activity as pattern. Industry as organism. The tension between built environment and natural world. Not good or evil, just... forces in motion.

Zoomed out: ants building, trucks flowing, smoke rising, lights blinking.
Zoomed in: one person carrying one thing to one place.

---

## Not Fantasy

No dwarves, no elves, no goblins, no magic.

Just:
- People
- Materials
- Machines
- Nature
- Time

The drama comes from systems interacting, not from lore.

---

## Influences (Mixed)

| From | Take | Leave |
|------|------|-------|
| **Dwarf Fortress** | Depth, simulation, emergent stories, fortress as organism | Fantasy setting, combat focus, UI hostility |
| **Factorio** | Flow, optimization, the factory as puzzle, pollution as consequence | Alien planet, combat, infinite resources |
| **Cataclysm DDA** | Modern/post-modern setting, scavenging, zone activities, realistic items | Roguelike death, zombie focus, single character |
| **RimWorld** | Colony management, mood, needs, storytelling | Sci-fi, raids as main challenge |
| **Satisfactory/Shapez** | Visual flow, belt satisfaction, building as expression | Pure puzzle, no survival pressure |
| **SimCity/Cities Skylines** | Urban systems, traffic, zoning, watching it breathe | Top-down god view, no individual agents |
| **Banished** | Sustainability, seasonal survival, quiet tone | Limited depth, no underground |

---

## The Setting

**Modern/industrial/near-future. Or timeless.**

Could be:
- Rebuilding after collapse (not zombies, just... things fell apart)
- Remote industrial outpost (mining colony, research station)
- Self-sufficient commune (off-grid by choice)
- Generational habitat (space station, underground bunker, island)

The point: **closed loop by necessity, not fantasy conceit.**

You can't order from Amazon. You make it, grow it, salvage it, or go without.

---

## What You Manage

Not heroes. Not warriors. Just **workers**.

```
People who:
- Get tired
- Get hungry
- Get cold/hot
- Have opinions
- Break things
- Fix things
- Make things
- Move things
```

The challenge isn't combat, it's **logistics and entropy**.

---

## The Core Tensions

### 1. Order vs Entropy

You build, nature reclaims. You clean, dirt returns. You repair, things break again.

Maintenance is not failure - it's the game.

### 2. Finite vs Renewable

Stone runs out. Ore depletes. But trees regrow. Crops cycle. Water flows.

The transition from extraction to sustainability is the arc.

### 3. Efficiency vs Resilience

Optimized systems are fragile. One broken link stops everything.

Redundancy costs resources but survives disasters.

### 4. Local vs Global

What's good for one workshop might starve another.

Throughput here means bottleneck there.

### 5. Now vs Later

Burn all the wood now, freeze next winter.

Harvest everything, nothing to plant.

---

## What Success Looks Like

Not "winning." Not "beating."

**Watching it work.**

```
The mine feeds the smelter
The smelter feeds the smith
The smith makes tools
The tools enable more mining
The cycle continues
```

```
Rain falls
Water flows to cistern
Cistern feeds irrigation
Crops grow
Harvest feeds workers
Workers maintain the cistern
```

**Self-sustaining loops are the goal.** Not because you "win" but because it's satisfying to watch.

---

## What Failure Looks Like

Not game over. Just... entropy winning for a while.

```
Forgot to stockpile wood
Winter came
Furnace went cold
Pipes froze
Water damaged the stockpile
Food rotted
Workers got sick
Nobody maintained the windmill
Power stopped
...
Spring came
Survivors rebuild
Lesson learned
```

The story is in the recovery as much as the collapse.

---

## Aesthetic

**Industrial pastoral.**

Concrete and grass. Rust and rain. Smoke and sunlight. Dirt paths worn by foot traffic. Clean geometry slowly softened by weather.

Not grimdark. Not utopian. Just... working. Wearing. Continuing.

**Sound:**
- Machines humming
- Hammers ringing
- Wind through structures
- Rain on roofs
- Footsteps on gravel, metal, wood
- Silence when things stop

**Color:**
- Earth tones (brown, grey, green, rust)
- Punctuated by fire glow, warning lights, water blue
- Weather shifts palette (grey rain, golden sun, white snow)

---

## Scale

**Colony, not empire.**

Maybe 20-100 workers, not thousands.

You can know individuals. "Oh, that's the one who's always tired." "That one hates the cold."

But also zoomed out: the flow of goods, the rhythm of shifts, the pulse of the system.

---

## Time

**Seasons matter. Years pass.**

Not real-time crisis management. Not turn-based strategy.

Somewhere between: time to think, but consequences for waiting.

Watch a tree grow. Watch a wall crumble. Watch paths form where people walk.

---

## The Koyaanisqatsi Moment

When you zoom out and just watch:

- Trucks (or carts, or movers) flowing along paths
- Smoke rising from workshops
- Lights flickering on at dusk
- Shift change as workers swap places
- Rain sweeping across, everyone seeking shelter
- Snow accumulating, paths getting trampled clear
- A fire spreading, people scrambling
- Recovery beginning, new patterns forming

**The game plays itself. You shaped the system. Now you watch it breathe.**

That's the moment.

---

## What This Is NOT

- Not a combat game (threats exist but aren't the point)
- Not a story game (stories emerge, aren't scripted)
- Not a puzzle game (optimization exists but isn't required)
- Not a survival game (survival is baseline, not goal)
- Not a city builder (too small, too personal)
- Not a factory game (people matter, not just throughput)

**It's a living system simulator with people in it.**

---

## The Cycle: Colony → Exodus → Colony

This isn't one colony forever. It's chapters.

```
Colony → Outgrow/Exhaust/Disaster → Expedition → Travel → New Colony
         ↑                                                    ↓
         └────────────── maybe return? trade routes? ─────────┘
```

---

### Phase 1: SETTLE

Build colony, extract resources, grow population.

The gameplay you'd expect - mining, building, crafting, maintaining.

---

### Phase 2: PEAK

Colony running well, but:
- Local resources thinning (mined out, deforested)
- Population outgrowing capacity
- Or disaster strikes (fire, flood, collapse)
- Or just... time to move on

---

### Phase 3: PREPARE

The exodus isn't instant. You build toward it.

```
Gather materials → Build vehicle → Load supplies → Choose who goes
```

**Vehicles (CDDA-style):**

Not just "click to travel." You physically construct your transport.

| Vehicle | Capacity | Speed | Terrain | Build Cost |
|---------|----------|-------|---------|------------|
| Handcart | Tiny | Slow | Roads only | Wood, wheels |
| Wagon | Medium | Medium | Most terrain | Wood, metal, wheels, axles |
| Truck | Large | Fast | Roads, rough | Engine, fuel, metal, rubber |
| Boat | Medium | Varies | Water only | Wood, tar, sail/engine |
| Train? | Huge | Fast | Rails only | Build rails first... |

The vehicle is a **mini-colony on wheels**:
- Storage space (what can you bring?)
- Fuel/food capacity (how far can you go?)
- Repair materials (things break on the road)
- Passenger space (who comes?)

**The hard choices:**

- Who comes, who stays?
- What fits, what's left behind?
- Do you strip the old colony for parts?
- Do you leave it functional for return, or others?

---

### Phase 4: EXODUS

The journey is gameplay, not a loading screen.

```
Generated terrain scrolls by (or you move through chunks)
```

**Travel events:**

| Event | Choice |
|-------|--------|
| River crossing | Ford it (risk), bridge (costs time), go around (costs fuel) |
| Breakdown | Repair with supplies, scavenge locally, abandon vehicle part |
| Weather | Shelter in vehicle, make camp, push through (risk) |
| Resources spotted | Stop to harvest (costs time), mark for later, ignore |
| Other survivors | Trade, recruit, avoid, conflict |
| Dangerous area | Detour (safe, slow), push through (fast, risky) |
| Vehicle stuck | Dig out, unload weight, wait for conditions to change |

**The journey has its own entropy:**

- Food runs out
- Fuel runs out
- Things break
- People get sick, tired, scared
- Weather changes
- You might not make it

---

### Phase 5: ARRIVE

Find new site. Start again.

But not from zero - you have:

**What carries over:**
- People (with their skills, relationships, quirks)
- Whatever fit in the vehicle
- Knowledge (blueprints, techniques, map data)
- Stories (what happened before)

**What's left behind:**
- Buildings (obviously)
- Stockpiles too big to move
- People who wouldn't or couldn't come
- Infrastructure (roads, irrigation, power)

**The new site might have:**
- Different resources (iron here, no copper)
- Different terrain (forest vs desert vs coast)
- Different challenges (flooding vs drought vs cold)
- Existing structures? (ruins to salvage, or dangers)

---

### The Long Game

Over multiple colonies:

```
Colony 1: Forest, learned woodworking, exhausted trees
    ↓ exodus through mountains
Colony 2: Mining outpost, learned metalwork, ore ran out
    ↓ exodus along river
Colony 3: Fertile valley, farming focus, flood destroyed it
    ↓ exodus to coast
Colony 4: Port town, trade focus, sustainable at last?
```

**Or circular:**

```
Colony 1 → Colony 2 → Colony 3
    ↑                    ↓
    └──── return ────────┘
```

The old colony still exists. Maybe it recovered. Maybe others moved in. Maybe it's ruins now. Trade routes between your colonies?

---

### Vehicles in Detail

**Construction:**

Vehicles are built tile-by-tile, CDDA-style:

```
[W][W][W]     W = wheel
[F][C][F]     F = frame
[W][S][W]     C = cab/seat
              S = storage
```

Each part:
- Has HP (breaks separately)
- Has weight (affects speed, fuel use)
- Has function (storage, seating, armor, cargo)

**Fuel types:**

| Fuel | Source | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Muscle | People/animals | Slow, always available |
| Wood/coal | Burn materials | Steam engine, needs water too |
| Oil/gas | Rare, scavenged | Fast, finite |
| Electric | Solar/wind charge | Slow charge, clean |
| Sail | Wind | Free but unpredictable |

**Terrain vs vehicle:**

```
Road: All vehicles, fastest
Grass: Most vehicles, slower  
Forest: Foot/animal only (or clear path)
Mountain: Foot only (or tunnels)
Water: Boats only
Snow: Sleds, or very slow
Sand: Bogs down wheeled vehicles
```

---

### Why This Changes Everything

The game has **rhythm** now:

```
Build → Sustain → Prepare → Travel → Build again
```

Each colony is a chapter with:
- Beginning (arrival, setup)
- Middle (growth, optimization)
- End (preparation, departure)

**No colony is precious.** You'll leave it behind. That changes how you build.

**The vehicle matters.** You're not just managing a colony, you're building your escape pod.

**The journey matters.** It's not loading screen, it's survival challenge.

**History accumulates.** Your people remember. The map remembers. The old colonies exist somewhere.

---

## Summary

Build order. Maintain order. Watch entropy push back. Find balance. Or don't - and watch what happens.

When it's time, build your vehicle, load what matters, and go find somewhere new.

No fantasy. No aliens. No zombies.

Just people, materials, machines, nature, time, distance.

And the loops that connect them all.

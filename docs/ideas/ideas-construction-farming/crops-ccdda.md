I've been doing a lot of farming, and trying out a lot of different crops. The subreddit has had a few discussions about farming recently and I thought it would be a nice idea to make a list of crops that are worth your time. Note I haven't grown everything on this list myself due to being unable to find the seeds, but I've consulted with the item browser to determine the overall usefulness of a crop where I don't have the experience. All crops leave behind withered plants when harvested, which is a good source of makeshift rope. Without further ado, here's the table.

CROP	TIER	NOTE
Barley	B	Can basically only make flour and booze
Blackberry	A	See note on berries
Blueberry	A	See note on berries
Broccoli	B	Basic-ass vegetable
Buckwheat	A	Makes great flour, does not rot
Cabbage	A	Tons of recipes, keeps ok.
Cannabis	A	Weed and plant fibre, seeds into oil
Canola	C	Cotton gives you way more seeds and oil, as well as thread
Carrot	B	Tons of recipes, keeps ok.
Celery	B	Tons of recipes, keeps ok.
Chilli Pepper	F	Used in basically nothing.
Corn	S	Makes a ton of stuff, including cornmeal, sugar.
Cotton	A	Slow growing but gives you infinite thread and oil through hundreds of seeds if you process the bolls.
Cranberry	A	See note on berries
Cucumber	B	Makes pickles
Dandelion	F	Good in a pinch, not very nutritious
Garlic	A	Gives tons of product, does not rot, used in many things.
Hops	F	Only used for beer making or tanning hides, but you have tanbark for that.
Lettuce	B	Doesn't keep and not used in much.
Oats	S	Fast growing, makes lots of oatmeal and flour, does not rot
Onion	B	Keeps well
Potato	B	Keeps well, makes good booze, used in lots of recipes
Pumpkin	C	Edible seeds, not a lot of product, recipes rot quickly.
Raspberry	A	See note on berries
Rhubarb	C	Basically only useful to make sugar
Strawberry	A	See note on berries
Sugar Beet	A	Can make sugar and other products.
Sunflower	C	Seeds can give oil or be eaten, not a lot of seeds though
Tomato	A	Possibly the most versatile vegetable. Can it for extra uses.
Wheat	A	Gives you flour and straw, which can be made into a bunch of things
Wild Herb	A	Makes massive amounts of herbs, easy to grow, used in lots
Wild Vegetable	B	Found everywhere, used in tons of recipes
Zucchini	C	Fast growing but doesn't keep super well and not used in many recipes
All berries and fruits will give you yeast as a byproduct if turned into must and fermented in a vat. Berry bushes can be harvested multiple times. Can also make non-perishable pemmican. Great for mass production of booze and/or biodiesel.

Flour is non perishable and is used in a lot of recipes. Flour-making foods are a godsend, so pay attention to them.

Here's a quick list of the medicinal plants:

CROP	NOTE
Bee Balm	Anti-flu tea
Datura	Can be used in anti-parasitic drugs or adrenaline
Dogbane	Only used for fibre (?)
Mugwort	Easier way to kill parasites than datura (not as effective???)
Thyme	Disinfectant oil
Poppy	Everyone's favourite painkiller

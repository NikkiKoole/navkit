> Hi im making a type of dwarf fortress game, but i want to kinda start in the stone age, help me ake short list of jobs

Here’s a short, stone-age-friendly job list you can start with (covers survival → tools → building → society):

Gatherer — collects berries, nuts, roots, wild plants

Hunter — tracks + kills animals, brings meat/hides

Fisher — catches fish/shellfish (river/coast)

Forager/Herbalist — finds medicinal plants, poisons, dyes

Woodcutter — chops trees, makes logs/branches

Firekeeper — maintains fires, makes charcoal, torches

Cook — turns raw food into meals, preserves (dry/smoke)

Water Carrier — hauls clean water, manages storage

Toolmaker (Knapping) — makes stone blades/axes/spears

Bone/Hide Worker — makes needles, hooks, clothing, tents

Weaver (Fibers) — makes rope, nets, simple cloth from plants

Builder — huts, palisades, basic structures

Digging/Quarry — pits, clay, stone gathering (early mining)

Potter — clay pots for storage/cooking

Tanner — processes hides (could be part of Hide Worker)

Medic/Shaman — treats injuries/illness, morale rituals

Hauler — general transport + stockpiles

Guard/Watcher — patrols, alarms, keeps predators/raiders away

If you want it even tighter (like 8 jobs), use: Gatherer, Hunter, Woodcutter, Firekeeper, Toolmaker, Builder, Cook, Hauler.

> are these inspired by dwarf fortress first or stone age ?

Mostly stone age first, with a Dwarf Fortress-style breakdown of labor.

Stone age inspired: Gatherer, Hunter, Fisher, Knapping/Toolmaker (stone tools), Bone/Hide Worker, Weaver (cordage/nets), Firekeeper/Charcoal, Potter, Tanner, Medic/Shaman. These map to real early subsistence + craft needs.

DF-inspired (game-structure choices): Hauler, Guard/Watcher, Builder as a general role, and the idea of splitting work into many togglable “labors” rather than having everyone do a bit of everything. DF also nudges you toward “production chains” (hunt → butcher/tan → craft) which fits nicely here.

So: the theme/materials are stone age; the job system shape is very DF-like.

> and what type of stone age jobs related to building/mining 

Here are solid stone-age building/mining-ish jobs (with a quick “what they do” so they’re easy to implement):

Building / Construction

Shelter Builder — huts, lean-tos, tent frames, windbreaks

Thatcher — roofs/walls from reeds, grass, straw

Wattle & Daub Builder — woven walls + clay/mud plaster

Carpenter (Woodworking) — beams, posts, ladders, platforms, gates

Stone Stacker (Dry-stone Mason) — cairns, low walls, terraces (no mortar)

Earthworker — leveling ground, ditches, berms, embankments

Palisade Builder — sharpened stakes, fence lines, basic fortifications

Road/Path Maker — clears routes, lays logs/stone, simple bridges

Scaffolder — temporary supports, ramps, work platforms

“Mining” / Excavation (stone-age appropriate)

Digger (Pits & Trenches) — storage pits, defensive ditches, latrines

Quarry Worker — gathers surface stone, breaks boulders, splits slabs

Flint/Chert Collector — searches nodules in riverbeds/cliffs for knapping

Clay Digger — digs clay for pottery, daub, brick

Sand/Gravel Gatherer — temper for pottery, drainage, simple mortar later

Ochre Miner — pigment for paint/rituals/trade

Salt Gatherer (if map supports it) — salt springs/evaporation, food preservation

Tunnel/Chalk Digger (late stone age) — simple mines for flint/chalk; higher collapse risk

Nice “production chain” combo jobs (fun in DF-likes)

Lime Burner (late stone age) — burns limestone/shells → lime for plaster/mortar

Brick/Tile Maker (early) — clay bricks/tiles, sun-dried then fired (later)

If you want a tight starter set focused on building + digging:
Woodworker, Earthworker, Shelter Builder, Dry-stone Mason, Quarry Worker, Clay Digger.

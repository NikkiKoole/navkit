# Eras & Progression

> How the game feels at each stage — from naked survival to industrial colony.
> Each era has a distinct **player role**, **core loop**, **gating resource**, and **victory moment** that transitions into the next.

---

## Overview

```
Era 0: Waking Up          1 mover, nothing         "Don't die today"
   ↓
Era 1: Settling           3-5 movers, shelters      "Store enough for winter"
   ↓
Era 2: The Village        5-15 movers, workshops    "Everyone has a role"
   ↓
Era 3: Mechanical Power   15-30 movers, machines    "Replace hands with wheels"
   ↓
Era 4: Industry           30-60 movers, factories   "Balance fuel vs output"
   ↓
Era 5: The Colony         60-100 movers, districts  "Maintain the lifestyle"
```

The player's role shifts from **desperate survivor** to **foreman** to **engineer** to **urban planner**. The simulation rules never change — the same hunger/energy/temperature systems run at every scale. What changes is what the player *worries about*.

---

## Era 0: Waking Up

*You are the inner voice of one person with nothing.*

### Characteristics

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Player role** | Direct controller — you ARE the mover |
| **Movers** | 1 (maybe 2) |
| **Core loop** | Gather → consume → survive until tomorrow |
| **Gating resource** | Calories. Everything is about not starving. |
| **Key tension** | Time — daylight is limited, hunger is constant |
| **Pace** | Frantic, moment-to-moment |

### What Exists

- Bare hands (0.5× speed for everything)
- Berry bushes (seasonal, unreliable)
- Grass, sticks, rocks on the ground
- Water to drink from (walk to source)
- Fire is possible but hard (no tools yet)

### What the Player Does

- Manually direct the mover to forage berries
- Scramble to find food before hunger hits
- Sleep on the ground (slow recovery)
- Try to knap a sharp stone from rocks — first real achievement

### Victory Moment → Era 1

**First tool crafted.** The sharp stone means gathering is no longer agonizingly slow. The player can now *think ahead* instead of reacting.

### Maps To Features

- F1 (Hunger & Foraging) — the entire era runs on this
- F4 Phase 1 only (knapping a sharp stone, bare minimum tools)

### Feeling

Tense, quiet, lonely. Wind in grass, footsteps, the crunch of knapping stone. Every berry found is a small victory. The world is enormous and you are tiny.

---

## Era 1: Settling

*You are a foreman directing a handful of survivors.*

### Characteristics

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Player role** | Task assigner — tell 3-5 movers what to do |
| **Movers** | 3–5 |
| **Core loop** | Gather → process → store → survive the season |
| **Gating resource** | Storage. You can gather plenty but it rots. |
| **Key tension** | Preservation — summer abundance must last through winter |
| **Pace** | Busy but manageable, seasonal rhythm emerges |

### What Exists

- Stone tools (axe, pick, hammer — work at normal speed)
- Baskets and clay pots (food doesn't rot on dirt anymore)
- Drying rack (berry preservation)
- Rope maker, kiln (existing workshops fully useful now)
- Beds and basic furniture (movers sleep properly)
- First buildings with doors (shelter from rain and cold)

### What the Player Does

- Assign movers to specialized tasks (one gathers, one processes, one builds)
- Build a shelter with door before autumn rains
- Fill baskets and pots with dried berries for winter
- Maintain a hearth for warmth inside the shelter
- Hunt animals for meat when berries are scarce
- Cook food at the hearth (cooked meat is the best food source)

### The Seasonal Cycle (First Time It Matters)

| Season | Activity | Pressure |
|--------|----------|----------|
| Spring | Plant berry bushes, repair buildings | Food reserves low after winter |
| Summer | Gather aggressively, dry/preserve everything | None — abundance |
| Autumn | Final harvest, fill containers, hunt | Winter is coming |
| Winter | Huddle in shelter, eat stores, craft tools | Starvation if unprepared |

### Victory Moment → Era 2

**First winter survived with surplus.** The colony has more food than it needs. Movers aren't scrambling — they have idle time. The question shifts from "will we survive?" to "what should we build?"

### Maps To Features

- F1B (Containers & Storage)
- F2 (Sleep & Furniture)
- F3 (Doors & Shelter)
- F4 (Tools & Knapping, full)
- F5 (Cooking & Hunting)

### Feeling

The relief of shelter. Firelight flickering through a doorway while rain pours outside. The satisfaction of a storeroom filling with baskets. The dread of counting supplies as autumn turns.

---

## Era 2: The Village

*You are a chief assigning roles in a small community.*

### Characteristics

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Player role** | Role assigner — who farms, who mines, who crafts |
| **Movers** | 5–15 |
| **Core loop** | Specialize → produce → trade internally → grow |
| **Gating resource** | Labor. Not enough hands for everything. |
| **Key tension** | Specialization — every mover doing X means nobody doing Y |
| **Pace** | Steady, planning-oriented, watching systems interlock |

### What Exists

- Farming (crops grow with seasons, weather, soil)
- Clothing (grass tunics, leather from hunting)
- Full workshop chain (sawmill, kiln, stonecutter, rope maker, loom, tailor, carpenter)
- Composting (leaves → fertilizer → better farms)
- Glass (sand → windows → better buildings)
- Movers with names, skills, moods

### What the Player Does

- Designate farm plots on good soil, plan crop rotation
- Assign specialist roles: farmer, miner, cook, crafter, builder
- Watch skills develop — Kira becomes an expert miner, Tomas a skilled farmer
- Manage moods: food variety, comfortable beds, sheltered rooms
- Build with purpose: storehouses for grain, workshops connected by paths
- Clothe movers before winter (leather coats for outdoor workers)

### The Skill Economy

Movers aren't interchangeable anymore. A level-15 miner is twice as fast as a level-0. Losing your best farmer to starvation or cold is devastating. This creates **attachment** — these are people, not units.

| Role | Key Skill | Impact |
|------|-----------|--------|
| Miner | Mining 15 | Opens stone/clay/ore access fast |
| Farmer | Farming 15 | Bigger harvests, less waste |
| Cook | Cooking 15 | Better food quality, mood bonus |
| Builder | Construction 15 | Faster building, less material waste (future) |
| Crafter | Crafting 15 | Workshop throughput |

### Village Layout Matters

Where you build matters now:
- Farms near water (rain + irrigation potential)
- Workshops near stockpiles (short haul distances)
- Beds near workshops (movers don't waste time walking home)
- Fences around farms (keep animals out)

### Victory Moment → Era 3

**Idle hands.** Food is automated (farms + cook), buildings are warm, movers are clothed. Some movers have nothing urgent to do. The player thinks: "If only I could move things faster... if the sawmill ran itself..."

### Maps To Features

- F6 (Farming & Crops)
- F7 (Clothing & Textiles)
- F8 (Water Carrying & Thirst)
- F9 (Loop Closers — glass, compost, lye)
- F10 (Personality, Skills & Moods)

### Feeling

Pride in what you've built. Walking through the village seeing each building's purpose. Knowing each mover by name. The hum of a working community. But also the nagging inefficiency — too many haulers, too much walking, not enough hours.

---

## Era 3: Mechanical Power

*You are an engineer designing systems that multiply labor.*

### Characteristics

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Player role** | System designer — connect power to machines |
| **Movers** | 15–30 |
| **Core loop** | Build infrastructure → connect power → automate → free labor |
| **Gating resource** | Power. Wind and water are free but location-dependent. |
| **Key tension** | Geography — water wheels need rivers, windmills need elevation |
| **Pace** | Deliberate, engineering-focused, big projects |

### What Exists (Planned)

- **Water wheel**: Placed on river, generates rotational power
- **Windmill**: Placed on elevation, wind-dependent (uses existing wind system)
- **Axles & gears**: Transmit power horizontally, turn corners
- **Powered workshops**: Sawmill, millstone, trip hammer — 5-10× output
- **Pumps**: Move water uphill (irrigation, mine drainage)
- **Hoists**: Move items vertically (mine shafts)

### What the Player Does

- Scout for river locations and hilltops
- Build a water wheel and connect it via axles to a powered sawmill
- One mover + powered sawmill = 10× plank output
- Build windmill as backup for calm days
- Pump water to hilltop farms (irrigation without rain dependence)
- Drain deeper mines with steam/water pumps to access new resources

### The Labor Multiplier

| Task | Manual | Powered | Freed Movers |
|------|--------|---------|-------------|
| Sawing planks | 1 mover, 6s/plank | 1 mover, 1s/plank | 5 |
| Grinding grain | 2 movers, 8s/batch | 1 mover, 2s/batch | 1.5 |
| Pumping water | 2 movers carrying pots | Automatic pump | 2 |
| Mine hoist | 3 haulers climbing ladders | 1 operator | 2 |

### Power Grid Gameplay

Power isn't magic — it's physical:
- Axles transmit in straight lines
- Gearboxes turn corners (expensive to craft)
- Distance matters — long axle runs lose efficiency
- Wind is unreliable — calm days mean no grinding
- Water is constant but fixed location

This is **Factorio-style** system design in a **colony sim** context.

### Victory Moment → Era 4

**Power surplus.** The water wheel runs the sawmill and millstone with capacity to spare. The player connects a bellows to the forge. Metal becomes possible. The question shifts from "how do I power this?" to "what should I make with all this power?"

### Maps To Features (Future)

- Steam power system (from AI discussions)
- Wind power system
- Axle/gear/belt transmission
- Powered workshop variants
- Pumps and hoists

### Feeling

The thump of the water wheel. The creak of axles. Watching a single mover produce what five did before. The satisfaction of a well-routed power network. But also the frustration of geography — the best river is far from the ore deposits.

---

## Era 4: Industry

*You are a factory manager balancing inputs and outputs.*

### Characteristics

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Player role** | Logistics manager — throughput, bottlenecks, supply chains |
| **Movers** | 30–60 |
| **Core loop** | Extract → refine → manufacture → distribute |
| **Gating resource** | Fuel. Steam needs wood/coal constantly. |
| **Key tension** | Sustainability — forests deplete, coal runs out, supply lines stretch |
| **Pace** | Constant monitoring, production dashboards, optimization |

### What Exists (Planned)

- **Steam engine**: Boiler + water + fuel → mechanical power anywhere
- **Conveyor belts**: Move items without movers (Factorio-style)
- **Smelter**: Ore → metal ingots
- **Forge**: Metal → tools, parts, machinery
- **Rail/carts**: Long-distance item transport (trains already exist!)
- **Advanced buildings**: Multi-story, specialized rooms

### What the Player Does

- Build steam engines to power workshops far from rivers
- Lay conveyor belts from mines to smelters to forges
- Manage fuel supply chains (woodcutting → charcoal → boiler)
- Connect distant mines via rail (train system already exists!)
- Design factory layouts for throughput optimization
- Balance: more steam power = more fuel consumption = more woodcutters needed

### The Fuel Dilemma

Steam is freedom from geography but slavery to fuel:
- Wood is renewable but slow (trees take time to regrow)
- Charcoal is efficient but requires processing
- Coal (deep mining) is dense but finite
- Managing this balance IS the gameplay

### Conveyor Belt Tiers

| Tier | Material | Speed | Power Source |
|------|----------|-------|-------------|
| Gravity chute | Wood | Downhill only | None |
| Mechanical belt | Leather/canvas | Medium | Water/steam |
| Advanced belt | Rubber (future) | Fast | Steam/electric |

### The Hauler Liberation

Before belts: 10 movers hauling ore from mine to smelter.
After belts: 0 movers hauling — belt does it automatically.
Those 10 movers are now free to build, farm, craft, or improve quality of life.

### Victory Moment → Era 5

**Self-sustaining production.** The factory runs with minimal oversight. Food is abundant, goods flow automatically. The player stops thinking about survival and starts thinking about *quality of life*. "My movers are fed and housed... but are they happy?"

### Maps To Features (Future)

- Steam power & boiler system
- Conveyor belts (from AI discussions)
- Metal smelting & forging
- Train logistics (extension of existing trains)
- Advanced construction

### Feeling

The roar of furnaces. Steam hissing from valves. The mesmerizing motion of conveyor belts carrying ore. Numbers and throughput ratios. The game has become Factorio wearing a colony sim's clothes — and that's the point.

---

## Era 5: The Colony

*You are a mayor managing a living community.*

### Characteristics

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Player role** | Urban planner — districts, services, quality of life |
| **Movers** | 60–100 |
| **Core loop** | Provide services → satisfy needs → maintain happiness → grow |
| **Gating resource** | Happiness. Movers demand comfort, variety, beauty. |
| **Key tension** | Complexity — 100 people with different needs, preferences, skills |
| **Pace** | Slow, strategic, watching the colony breathe |

### What Exists (Planned)

- **Districts**: Residential, industrial, agricultural zones
- **Services**: Tavern, clinic, market, temple (future workshops)
- **Consumer goods**: Furniture quality tiers, decorations, varied food
- **Social simulation**: Relationships, gatherings, conflicts
- **Autonomy**: Movers handle most decisions themselves

### What the Player Does

- Design residential districts (apartments with plumbing, furniture, light)
- Ensure food variety (multiple crops, meats, cooked meals)
- Provide entertainment and services (future: tavern, market)
- Manage social dynamics (future: mover relationships)
- Plan expansion (new districts, infrastructure corridors)
- Watch the colony live — this is where storytelling peaks

### The Sims Transition

The game has shifted from Factorio to The Sims:
- Early: "How do I produce enough planks?"
- Now: "Does every apartment have a window and good furniture?"
- Individual movers have histories, skills, preferences
- The founder from Era 0 is now an old expert, sitting on a bench

### Colony Metrics

| Metric | Bad | Okay | Good |
|--------|-----|------|------|
| Average mood | < -0.2 | -0.2 to 0.2 | > 0.2 |
| Food variety | 1 type | 2-3 types | 4+ types |
| Housing | Ground/barracks | Shared rooms | Private rooms |
| Employment | Overworked | Balanced | Specialized |
| Infrastructure | Manual haul | Partial belts | Full automation |

### Victory Moment → ???

**The Exodus.** The colony is complete. Self-sustaining, happy, productive. But the world is bigger. Movers construct a vehicle — cart, ship, or train — and a party sets out to found a new colony elsewhere. They carry knowledge and some supplies, but start building again from scratch in a new biome. The cycle repeats, richer this time.

(From vision.md: Colony → Exodus → Colony. The endgame is the journey, not the destination.)

### Maps To Features (Future)

- Social system, relationships
- District/zone management
- Service buildings (tavern, market, clinic)
- Consumer goods & decoration
- Colony cycle / exodus mechanic

### Feeling

Zooming out to see the whole colony. Smoke rising from chimneys, movers walking between buildings, trains arriving at the station. Each building placed with purpose over dozens of hours. The quiet pride of a world you built from one naked person in the grass.

---

## Era Transitions: The Moments That Matter

The grand colony AI discussion nailed it: **transitions are where the magic lives.** Not the era itself, but the moment you cross from one to the next.

| Transition | The Moment | Why It Feels Good |
|------------|-----------|-------------------|
| 0 → 1 | First tool | Manual labor becomes bearable |
| 1 → 2 | First winter survived | Scarcity becomes abundance |
| 2 → 3 | First mover with idle time | Survival becomes building |
| 3 → 4 | First powered workshop | One person does five people's work |
| 4 → 5 | First automatic supply chain | You stop micromanaging production |
| 5 → Exodus | Colony is self-sustaining | You let go and start again |

Each transition should feel **earned**. The player should remember the moment they no longer had to manually haul water, or the first time the sawmill ran by itself. These quality-of-life upgrades are the reward for mastering each era.

---

## What's Buildable Now vs Later

| Era | Status | Depends On |
|-----|--------|-----------|
| **Era 0** | Buildable with Features 1 + F4 (knapping only) | Current codebase + 2 features |
| **Era 1** | Buildable with Features 1B–5 | Era 0 + 4 features |
| **Era 2** | Buildable with Features 6–10 | Era 1 + 5 features |
| **Era 3** | Needs new systems (power, transmission) | Era 2 + power system |
| **Era 4** | Needs new systems (steam, belts, metal) | Era 3 + industrial systems |
| **Era 5** | Needs new systems (social, services) | Era 4 + colony management |

**The 11 planned features (F1 through F10) cover Eras 0–2 completely.** That's the "stone age vertical slice" — naked person to functioning village. If that loop is fun, everything after builds on it.

---

## The Autarkic Thread

Every era is connected by autarky — self-sufficiency through closed loops:

- **Era 0**: Gather → eat → survive (loop: calories in, energy out)
- **Era 1**: Gather → process → store → survive winter (loop: seasonal stockpiling)
- **Era 2**: Farm → cook → eat → compost → fertilize → farm (loop: food cycle)
- **Era 3**: Harvest wood → build wheel → power sawmill → harvest more wood (loop: power multiplier)
- **Era 4**: Mine coal → fire boiler → power smelter → make rails → mine more coal (loop: industrial flywheel)
- **Era 5**: Produce goods → satisfy needs → happy movers → more production (loop: quality of life)

Each era's loop is more complex but follows the same principle: **close the circle, use what you make.**

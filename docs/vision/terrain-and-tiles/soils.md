Sure — here’s a very beginner-friendly tile “matrix” of soil/ground types you can draw, aimed at making it easy to show where plants can grow and how “good” the ground is.

Soil / ground tile matrix (beginner set)

Think of this as a grid of choices: wetness × richness, plus a few special tiles.

1) Core growable soils (the main 3×3)

Use these as your “plantable” tiles.

Wetness → Dry | Normal | Wet
Richness ↓

	Dry	Normal	Wet
Poor	Dusty dirt (light brown, cracks)	Thin dirt (patchy, pebbles)	Mucky dirt (dull brown, small puddles)
Medium	Dry soil (crumbly, few cracks)	Good soil (dark brown, soft texture)	Damp soil (dark + slight shine)
Rich	Composty soil (dark + bits/leaves)	Fertile soil (very dark, smooth)	Rich mud (very dark + water sheen)

What to draw (simple cues):

Dry: cracks, lighter color, dust specks

Normal: crumb texture, tiny stones

Wet: subtle shine, tiny puddles, darker edges

Poor: more stones, less “smooth”

Rich: leaf bits, little fibers, darker tone

2) “Non-growable” or conditional ground (small add-ons)

These help variety and rules.

Tile	Visual idea	Use in gameplay (optional)
Sand	yellow/tan with grain dots	plants struggle / special plants only
Clay	reddish/brown, smooth lumps	holds water, harder to dig
Gravel	lots of small rocks	non-growable
Stone ground	flat rocks/plates	non-growable, paths
Mulch layer	wood chips texture	boosts nearby soil / decorative
Peat	dark, spongy patches	fuel source / wetland indicator
3) Edge/detail tiles (makes it look “real” fast)

If you only do a few transitions, do these:

Soil ↔ Grass edge (grass creeping in)

Soil ↔ Path edge (dirt worn by footsteps)

Soil ↔ Wall edge (dirt darker near wall, little debris)

Waterlogged edge (mud near water)

Minimal “starter pack” (if you want the smallest useful set)

If you don’t want 9 soils yet, draw just 5 tiles:

Thin dirt (poor/normal)

Good soil (medium/normal)

Fertile soil (rich/normal)

Dry soil (medium/dry)

Damp soil (medium/wet)

That already gives you believable farming ground.

Quick palette guidance (so it reads clearly)

Poor dirt: lighter brown + more gray stones

Good soil: darker brown, even texture

Fertile: almost chocolate-dark + organic bits

Wet versions: same as above but slightly darker + tiny highlights

If you tell me your tile size (e.g., 16×16 / 32×32) and whether it’s top-down or isometric, I can turn this into a super specific “draw checklist” per tile (like “3 pebbles here, 2 cracks there, 1 puddle highlight”).

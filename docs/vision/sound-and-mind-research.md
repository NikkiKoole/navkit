# Sound and Mind - Research Index

Context
- This is a split of the earlier combined note so each track stays focused.
- The project already has a synth engine in `soundsystem/engines/synth.h` for agent vocal output.

Tracks
- Speech and Communication: `docs/vision/sound-and-mind-speech-comm.md`
- Birdsong and Sexual Selection: `docs/vision/sound-and-mind-birdsong-sex.md`
- System Design: `docs/vision/sound-and-mind-design.md`

Shared Foundations
- Signals only emerge when they change outcomes.
- Cultural transmission can be faster and more interesting than slow evolution.
- You can mix "call-like" (short, information-dense) and "song-like" (longer, aesthetic) vocalizations.

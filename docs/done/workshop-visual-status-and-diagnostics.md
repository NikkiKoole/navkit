# Workshop Visual Status & Diagnostics - COMPLETE ✅

**Completion Date:** 2026-02-13  
**Estimated Effort:** 5-6 hours  
**Actual Effort:** ~3 hours  
**Commit:** 3a16956

## Overview

Implemented visual status indicators and enhanced diagnostic tooltips for workshops, providing at-a-glance status information and actionable feedback about workshop problems.

## What Was Implemented

### Part A: Visual Status Overlay (rendering.c)

**New Function:** `DrawWorkshopStatusOverlay()`
- Draws status icons centered on each workshop tile
- Icons are 50% of cell size, overlaid on workshop sprite
- Uses existing atlas sprites (no new art needed)

**Status Icons:**
- 🟢 **WORKING** - Green pulsing dot (`SPRITE_middle_dot`)
  - Pulse effect: `sin(time * 4.0) * 0.3 + 0.7` (0.7-1.0 alpha)
  - Indicates workshop is actively producing
  
- 🔴 **OUTPUT_FULL** - Red square (`SPRITE_full_block`)
  - Solid red, no animation
  - Indicates output is blocked (no stockpile space)
  
- 🟡 **INPUT_EMPTY** - Yellow division sign (`SPRITE_division`)
  - Solid yellow
  - Indicates waiting for materials
  
- ⚪ **NO_WORKER** - Gray head icon (`SPRITE_head`)
  - Semi-transparent (alpha 200)
  - Indicates no crafter assigned

**Integration:**
- Called from main render loop after `DrawWorkshops()`
- Only draws on current z-level (respects `currentViewZ`)
- Function declaration added to `main.c`

### Part B: Enhanced Tooltip Diagnostics (tooltips.c)

**Enhanced `DrawWorkshopTooltip()`**
- Added ~130 lines of diagnostic logic
- Shows after "Crafter:" line, before "Passive workshop status"

**Status Line:**
- Color-coded summary of current state
- "Status: Working (producing items)" - green
- "Status: Output Blocked" - red
- "Status: Waiting for Input" - yellow
- "Status: No Worker Assigned" - gray

**Detailed Diagnostics for OUTPUT_FULL:**
```
Status: Output Blocked
  Output blocked: Plank (x5)
  Hint: Build stockpile accepting Plank
```

**Detailed Diagnostics for INPUT_EMPTY:**
```
Status: Waiting for Input
  Waiting for: Oak Log (x1)
  Waiting for: Fuel (any burnable item)
```

**Implementation Details:**
- Checks first active bill's recipe for specific requirements
- For INPUT_EMPTY: scans items to determine which inputs are missing
  - Checks input1 with `RecipeInputMatches()`
  - Checks input2 if `recipe->inputType2 != ITEM_NONE`
  - Checks fuel if `recipe->fuelRequired > 0`
- For OUTPUT_FULL: shows blocked output item name and quantity
- Skips reserved items (`item->reservedBy != -1`)
- Only checks items on same z-level as workshop

## Files Modified

1. **src/render/rendering.c** (+64 lines)
   - `DrawWorkshopStatusOverlay()` function
   - Icon rendering with sprite lookup
   - Pulse animation for working state

2. **src/main.c** (+2 lines)
   - Function declaration
   - Render call after `DrawLinkingModeHighlights()`

3. **src/render/tooltips.c** (+122 lines)
   - Status line display
   - OUTPUT_FULL diagnostics
   - INPUT_EMPTY diagnostics with material scanning

## Testing Checklist

✅ **WORKING State**
- Workshop has crafter, bill, inputs available, and storage space
- Green pulsing dot appears on workshop tile
- Tooltip shows "Status: Working (producing items)" in green

✅ **OUTPUT_FULL State**
- Workshop blocked because no stockpile accepts output
- Red square appears on workshop tile
- Tooltip shows specific blocked item and hint

✅ **INPUT_EMPTY State**
- Workshop has bill but missing input materials
- Yellow division sign appears on workshop tile
- Tooltip shows specific missing materials (input1, input2, or fuel)

✅ **NO_WORKER State**
- Workshop has bill but no assigned crafter
- Gray head icon appears on workshop tile
- Tooltip shows "Status: No Worker Assigned" in gray

✅ **Multiple Workshops**
- Icons appear on all active workshops simultaneously
- Each shows correct status independently

✅ **Z-Level Switching**
- Icons only appear on current z-level
- Correctly update when changing levels

✅ **Passive Workshops**
- Kiln/furnace states work correctly
- Visual states respect passive workshop logic

✅ **Tooltip Line Limit**
- Diagnostic lines respect 28-line limit
- No buffer overflows or truncation issues

## User Experience Improvements

**Before:**
- No visual indication of workshop status from map view
- Tooltip showed generic "Crafter: None" or position info
- Hard to diagnose why workshop isn't producing

**After:**
- Instant visual feedback from colored icons
- Specific diagnostic messages like "Waiting for: Oak Log (x1)"
- Actionable hints like "Build stockpile accepting Plank"
- Can scan multiple workshops at a glance

## Technical Notes

**Sprite Reuse Strategy:**
- Used existing sprites from atlas (no new art generation needed)
- `SPRITE_middle_dot` works well for "working" indicator
- `SPRITE_full_block` clearly indicates "blocked"
- `SPRITE_division` (÷) resembles warning symbol
- `SPRITE_head` naturally represents "no worker"

**Performance:**
- Overlay: O(workshopCount) - very fast, just icon draws
- Tooltip diagnostics: only computed when hovering (not every frame)
- Item scanning uses `itemHighWaterMark` for efficiency

**Future Enhancements:**
- Could add specific sprite icons for each state (gear, box, warning, person)
- Could show material icons in diagnostic lines
- Could add click-to-fix actions (assign worker, build stockpile)
- Could highlight problem stockpiles when hovering blocked workshop

## Related Features

- Workshop system (`workshops.c`)
- Workshop diagnostics (`WorkshopVisualState` enum)
- Stockpile system (`stockpiles.c`)
- Recipe system (`recipes.c`)
- Tooltip system (`tooltips.c`)

## Notes for Future Work

1. The `visualState` field is already computed by workshop update logic in `workshops.c`
2. Diagnostics check unreserved items only (`reservedBy != -1`)
3. Tooltip checks use same logic as job assignment (material matching, fuel detection)
4. Icon positioning uses workshop center: `(x + width/2, y + height/2)`
5. All diagnostic strings fit within 80-char tooltip line buffer

## Success Criteria - All Met ✅

- ✅ Visual icons appear on workshop tiles
- ✅ Icons update in real-time as workshop state changes
- ✅ Tooltips show specific blocked/missing items
- ✅ Tooltips provide actionable hints
- ✅ No performance impact
- ✅ Code compiles without errors
- ✅ Works with all workshop types
- ✅ Respects z-level filtering

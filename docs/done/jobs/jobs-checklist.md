# Jobs System - Remaining Work

*See [jobs-checklist-completed.md](../done/jobs-checklist-completed.md) for completed phases.*

---

## Pending: UI Improvements
- [ ] Stockpile config panel (priority, stack size UI)
- [ ] Requester stockpiles - "keep N items here" mode

## Pending: Robustness
- [ ] Reservation timeouts (auto-release orphaned reservations)
- [ ] Connectivity regions (cheap reachability check before pathfinding)

## Pending: Crafting Expansion
- [ ] More workshops (carpenter, smelter, forge, etc.)
- [ ] Bill modes: Do X times, Do until X, Do forever
- [ ] Input/output stockpile linking

## Future / Later
- [ ] Zone activities (zones that generate jobs)
- [ ] Farming (multi-stage growth)
- [ ] Skills/labor priorities per mover
- [ ] Elevators for vertical transport
- [ ] Job priority reordering (mining vs hauling priority)

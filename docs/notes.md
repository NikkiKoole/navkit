Since we now made a start with the crafting, lots of jobgiving will be done, we now had to use the hybri mode, we still  need to double check if that is a good compromse between the old assignjobslegacy and assignjobshybrid. 

the AssignJobsWorkGivers is in any case too slow. we need to benchmark all of this and make a good place where we can give differnt kind of jobs. some fro large groups some for individual.

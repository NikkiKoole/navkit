# Requester Stockpiles

Stockpiles that maintain a target amount ("keep N items here").

## Examples

- "Keep 30 coal near the forge"
- "Keep 20 meals near dining"

## Notes

- Generates jobs to maintain target amounts
- Natural extension of stockpile priority system
- Factorio-style logistics with pawns instead of belts

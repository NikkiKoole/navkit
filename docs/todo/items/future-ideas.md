# Items — Future Ideas

Small ideas not yet fleshed out.

---

## Containers
Portable storage (chests, barrels, wagons, bins, bags).
- Containers are items themselves (can be hauled, stored in stockpiles)
- Containers also hold other items inside

## Tool Qualities / Prerequisites
Recipes require tool qualities (CUT, SCREW, etc.) rather than specific tools.
- Tools have charges/durability
- Adds crafting depth without huge item list
- The interesting part is the requirements graph
- Cataclysm DDA-style system

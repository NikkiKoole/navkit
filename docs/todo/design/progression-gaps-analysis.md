# Progression Gaps Analysis

An analysis of what's missing from the current progression system and how to complete it into a coherent bare-hands → stone fortress arc.

**Date:** 2026-02-11
**Updated:** 2026-02-12
**Context:** Based on `progression-story.md` and current codebase state

## Critical Gaps in Current Progression

### 1. ~~**Rock Gathering is Unrealistic**~~ RESOLVED

**Original concern:** "mining with bare hands" not believable.

**Resolution:** Mining is bare-hands by default — all movers have `canMine=true` with no tool requirement. Rocks are regular ground items that movers haul normally. This is consistent with the game's current "no tools" state. When tools are added later, mining could be gated behind a pickaxe, at which point surface scatter/boulders would become relevant as an early-game source.

**Optional future enhancement:** Surface scatter, boulders, or river stones could add variety to rock sourcing even without tool gating.

---

### 2. ~~**Cordage Has No Purpose**~~ RESOLVED

**Original problem:** SHORT_STRING and CORDAGE existed but weren't used anywhere.

**Resolution (2026-02-12):** Construction staging implemented. Cordage is now consumed by:
- Wattle & daub wall, frame stage: 2 STICKS + 1 CORDAGE
- Plank wall, frame stage: 2 STICKS + 1 CORDAGE

Fiber loop is now **CLOSED**: bark/dried grass → short string → cordage → construction.

---

### 3. ~~**No Primitive Shelter**~~ MOSTLY RESOLVED

**Original problem:** No intermediate shelter between nothing and stone blocks.

**Resolution (2026-02-12):** Two primitive construction options now exist:
- **Wattle & daub wall** (2-stage): frame (sticks + cordage) → fill (dirt or clay). Uses only gathered materials.
- **Thatch floor** (2-stage): base (dirt/gravel/sand) → finish (dried grass).

**Remaining:** Lean-to structure (POLES + CORDAGE + DRIED_GRASS) not yet implemented. POLES still have no construction sink.

---

### 4. **Sand/Dirt/Leaves Are Dead Ends** 🟡

**Problem:** These items are gathered but have no recipe sinks.

**Current State:**
- ITEM_SAND - gatherable from MAT_SAND cells, no recipe use
- ITEM_DIRT - gatherable from MAT_DIRT cells, no recipe use
- ITEM_LEAVES - gatherable from trees, only use is fuel (IF_FUEL flag)

**Solutions:**
- **Sand** → Glass Kiln (SAND + fuel → GLASS) for windows
  - New workshop: WORKSHOP_GLASS_KILN
  - Recipe: SAND x2 + 1 fuel → GLASS x1
  - GLASS used for windows, containers (future)
- **Dirt** → Farming system (plant crops in dirt)
  - Requires full farming system (future, deferred)
  - Alternative: composting (DIRT + LEAVES → COMPOST for enriched soil)
- **Leaves** → Composting (LEAVES + DIRT → COMPOST) for farming
  - Or: Mulch recipe (LEAVES x5 → MULCH x1 at workshop)
  - MULCH used as soil amendment (future farming) or bedding

**Impact:** Closes gathering loops, enables farming/glass systems.

**Implementation Priority:**
1. Glass Kiln (simple, closes sand loop immediately)
2. Leaf mulching (simple workshop recipe)
3. Composting (ties dirt + leaves together, enables farming later)

---

### 5. **Construction Is Too Simple** 🟡

**Problem:** Place blueprint → haul 1 item → wall appears instantly. No time investment, no staging.

**Current System:**
- Blueprint placed → JOBTYPE_BUILD created → mover walks to site → 3s work → wall appears
- No material preparation, no multi-step process, no visible construction phases

**Solutions (from docs/todo/design/construction-staging.md):**
- **Frame stage** - build skeleton first (fast, uses sticks/poles/cordage)
  - Visible as transparent/ghosted structure
  - Walkable (or not, depending on design)
- **Fill stage** - add walls/floors (slower, uses planks/bricks/blocks)
  - Each stage = separate hauling burst + work time
- **Curing/settling stage** (optional, future) - wait time before usable

**Impact:** Construction feels earned, stockpile logistics matter, progression is visible.

**Implementation Notes:**
- Add `uint8_t stage` to Blueprint struct (0 = frame, 1 = fill, 2 = complete)
- Add `Recipe frameRecipe` and `Recipe fillRecipe` to construction system
- JOBTYPE_BUILD checks current stage, uses appropriate recipe
- Visual: render partial structures differently per stage
- Storage checks need to verify space for BOTH stages' outputs

---

### 6. **No Water Interaction** 🟡

**Problem:** Water exists (flows, visible) but movers never use it.

**Current State:**
- Water simulation works (cellular automata, flow, evaporation)
- Water tiles render correctly
- But: no crafting uses water, no hauling water, no water-dependent recipes

**Solutions (from docs/todo/design/water-dependent-crafting.md):**
- **Water placement tools** - SetWaterSource/SetWaterDrain already exist, just need UI actions
  - ACTION_PLACE_WATER_SOURCE
  - ACTION_PLACE_WATER_DRAIN
- **Mud Mixer workshop** - DIRT + CLAY + water tile → MUD (location-based, no container needed)
  - Must be placed on water cell or adjacent to water
  - Recipe checks for water at work tile
  - MUD used for wattle-daub construction
- **Simple container** (future) - ITEM_BASKET (woven from cordage) for hauling water later

**Impact:** Water becomes gameplay element, enables mud/cob construction, unlocks clay-working area.

**Implementation Notes:**
- Add water placement actions to ACTION_REGISTRY
- Add WORKSHOP_MUD_MIXER with placement validator (CheckAdjacentWater)
- Recipe: DIRT x2 + CLAY x1 → MUD x3 (no fuel, location provides water)
- Future: add ITEM_WATER (requires containers) for hauling to non-water locations

---

### 7. **No Tools = No Progression** 🟡

**Problem:** Everything is done with bare hands at same speed forever.

**Current State:**
- All jobs (mining, chopping, crafting) have fixed work times
- No equipment/tool system
- No job speed modifiers
- ITEM_AXE and ITEM_PICKAXE mentioned in docs but not in items.h

**Solutions (from docs/todo/jobs/overview.md):**
- **Stone hammer** - ROCK + STICKS → faster mining (2x speed)
- **Stone axe** - ROCK + STICKS → faster chopping (2x speed)
- **Tools system** - durability, job speed multipliers
  - Add `int heldItem` to Mover struct (-1 = bare hands)
  - Add tool requirements to job types (mining prefers pickaxe, chopping prefers axe)
  - Jobs check for tool, apply speed multiplier
  - Tools have durability, break after N uses

**Impact:** Progression from slow bare-hands → efficient tooled work. Closes stone→stick loop.

**Implementation Priority:**
- Phase 1: Basic tools (stone hammer/axe) with speed bonuses, no durability
- Phase 2: Tool durability and breakage
- Phase 3: Tool tiers (stone → bronze → iron)

---

### 8. **Block Types Feel Identical** 🟡

**Problem:** Stone blocks, brick blocks, wood planks all build the same way with same effort.

**Current State:**
- ITEM_BLOCKS (stone), ITEM_BRICKS, ITEM_PLANKS all have IF_BUILDING_MAT flag
- Construction blueprint consumes 1 item, places wall instantly
- No material differentiation in construction time, staging, or properties

**Solutions:**
- **Material properties**
  - Stone walls are fireproof, wood walls burn, brick is middle ground
  - Already partially implemented: material system exists, fire system exists
  - Need: wall flammability based on wallMaterial
- **Construction time**
  - Stone takes 2x longer to place than wood (BLOCKS: 6s work, PLANKS: 3s work)
  - Brick is middle (4s work)
- **Staging requirements**
  - Stone needs frame + fill (2 stages)
  - Wood needs frame + fill (2 stages)
  - Wattle-daub needs frame + daub (2 stages)
- **Visual differentiation**
  - Distinct sprites for block walls vs brick walls (mentioned as missing in overview.md)
  - Currently: blocks/bricks use generic material sprite
  - Need: dedicated SPRITE_wall_stone_block, SPRITE_wall_brick, etc.

**Impact:** Material choice matters, construction feels different per tier.

**Implementation Notes:**
- Add per-material work time multipliers to construction jobs
- Fire system already checks wallMaterial, just needs flammability table
- Sprite atlas needs dedicated wall sprites (currently reusing item sprites)

## Suggested Priority Order (Most Impact First)

### Phase A: Complete the Fiber Loop ⭐⭐⭐
**Why:** Cordage exists but is useless. This is the biggest immediate gap.

**Tasks:**
1. **Construction staging** (frame + fill) - uses cordage, sticks, poles
   - Add `stage` field to Blueprint struct
   - Frame recipe: STICKS x2 + CORDAGE x1
   - Fill recipe: material-dependent (PLANKS/BRICKS/BLOCKS)
2. **Primitive shelter tiles** - lean-to, wattle-daub using cordage
   - New material: MAT_WATTLE_DAUB
   - Construction: frame (STICKS + CORDAGE) + daub (DIRT/CLAY)

**Time Estimate:** ~2-3 days
**Unlocks:** Cordage purpose, early shelter, construction depth
**Closes Loops:** Bark → string → cordage → construction

---

### Phase B: Bare-Hands Rock Gathering ⭐⭐
**Why:** Makes first 5 minutes believable.

**Tasks:**
1. **Surface scatter** - spawn loose rocks during worldgen
   - Worldgen: place ITEM_ROCK near exposed stone (1-3 rocks per stone patch)
2. **Boulder designation** - gather job on natural stone walls
   - DESIGNATION_GATHER_BOULDER on surface stone walls
   - JOBTYPE_GATHER_BOULDER: 5s work → 3-5 ITEM_ROCK, wall consumed
3. **River stones** - gather job near water
   - Worldgen: scatter ITEM_ROCK near water cells
   - Or: DESIGNATION_GATHER_RIVER_STONE (similar to boulder)

**Time Estimate:** ~1 day
**Unlocks:** Realistic early game, no "mining with bare hands"
**Closes Loops:** N/A (enables existing loops earlier)

---

### Phase C: Water Access ⭐⭐
**Why:** Water exists but is ignored. Small effort, big payoff.

**Tasks:**
1. **Water placement UI** - actions for SetWaterSource/SetWaterDrain (functions exist)
   - ACTION_PLACE_WATER_SOURCE and ACTION_PLACE_WATER_DRAIN
   - Add to ACTION_REGISTRY, wire to input handler
2. **Mud Mixer workshop** - DIRT + CLAY + water → MUD (no container needed yet)
   - WORKSHOP_MUD_MIXER with template
   - Placement validator: CheckAdjacentWater (work tile must be water or adjacent)
   - Recipe: DIRT x2 + CLAY x1 → MUD x3

**Time Estimate:** ~1-2 days
**Unlocks:** Water gameplay, mud/cob construction, clay-working areas
**Closes Loops:** Dirt + clay → mud (partial, needs mud sink)

---

### Phase D: Close Open Loops ⭐
**Why:** Items with no purpose feel incomplete.

**Tasks:**
1. **Glass Kiln** - SAND + fuel → GLASS (closes sand loop)
   - WORKSHOP_GLASS_KILN (similar to kiln, needs fuel)
   - Recipe: SAND x2 + 1 fuel → GLASS x1
   - ITEM_GLASS added to items.h
2. **Leaves composting** - LEAVES → COMPOST or MULCH (closes leaf loop)
   - Recipe at new workshop or existing (Hearth? Drying Rack?)
   - LEAVES x5 → MULCH x1 (no fuel, passive or short work)
3. **Thatch usage** - DRIED_GRASS as roofing material in construction
   - Add MAT_THATCH to materials
   - Roof construction: DRIED_GRASS x4 → thatch roof tile

**Time Estimate:** ~2-3 days
**Unlocks:** All gatherable items have purpose, no dead ends
**Closes Loops:** Sand → glass, leaves → mulch, dried grass → roofing

---

### Phase E: Tools (Later) ⭐
**Why:** Bigger system, can wait until loops are closed.

**Tasks:**
1. Tools system (durability, speed bonuses)
   - Add `int heldItem` to Mover struct
   - Add tool requirements to JobType
   - Add speed multipliers (bare hands: 1.0x, stone tools: 2.0x)
2. Stone hammer, stone axe recipes
   - ITEM_STONE_HAMMER, ITEM_STONE_AXE
   - Recipes at Stonecutter: ROCK + STICKS x2 → tool
3. Tool durability (optional, phase 2)
   - Add `uint16_t durability` to Item struct
   - Tools break after N uses, spawn broken item

**Time Estimate:** ~3-5 days
**Unlocks:** Efficiency progression, tool economy
**Closes Loops:** Rock + sticks → tools (closes multi-loop)

---

## What This Achieves

**Before (current state):**
- ✅ Gather → workshops → construction works
- ❌ Cordage is pointless
- ❌ Rock gathering is unrealistic (bare-hands mining)
- ❌ Construction is instant/identical for all materials
- ❌ Sand/dirt/leaves are dead ends
- ❌ Water is decorative only
- ❌ No primitive shelter
- ❌ No tool progression

**After (complete progression):**
- ✅ All gathered items have purpose (no dead ends)
- ✅ Cordage closes fiber loop (bark/grass → string → cordage → construction)
- ✅ Realistic rock gathering (surface scatter, boulders, river stones)
- ✅ Construction feels earned (staging, time investment, visible phases)
- ✅ Sand → glass, leaves → mulch, dirt → mud (loops closed)
- ✅ Water is interactive (placement, mud mixer, future hauling)
- ✅ Primitive shelter (lean-to, wattle-daub) bridges bare hands → stone
- ✅ Tool progression (bare hands → stone tools → efficiency boost)
- ✅ Material differentiation (wood/brick/stone feel different)

**Progression arc:**
1. Bare hands gathering → 2. Cordage/primitive shelter → 3. Stone tools → 4. Wood processing → 5. Mud/clay/fire → 6. Stone fortifications

Each era builds on the previous, no gaps, all items meaningful.

## Smallest Complete Next Step

If you want **one feature that does the most**, I recommend:

### **Construction Staging + Cordage Use** (~2-3 days)

**Why this first:**
- Fixes the biggest gap: cordage exists but is useless
- Transforms construction from instant → multi-phase process
- Enables primitive shelter (wattle-daub)
- Makes stockpile logistics meaningful
- Sets foundation for material differentiation

**What it includes:**
1. Add `stage` field to Blueprint struct
2. Frame stage recipe: STICKS x2 + CORDAGE x1
3. Fill stage recipe: PLANKS/BRICKS/BLOCKS (material-dependent)
4. Visual: render partial structures differently
5. Wattle-daub variant: frame + DIRT/CLAY daub

**What it unlocks:**
- Cordage loop complete (bark → string → cordage → construction)
- Primitive shelter (wattle-daub hut)
- Construction progression (lean-to → hut → cabin → fortress)
- Foundation for future staging complexity (curing, multi-colonist, etc.)

This single feature would transform the progression from "instant walls" to "build shelter, then upgrade to cabin, then fortress."

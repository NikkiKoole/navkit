# A Character's Story: Waking Up in the Grassy Plains

*A feature gap analysis told through the eyes of a single character waking up naked in the world.*

---

## Chapter 1: The First Hour — "I'm Fine, Actually"

The world has **temperature** (it's a pleasant 20C), **water** flowing somewhere nearby, and **fire** can spread through the grass. The sun casts light across the terrain. So the world *feels* alive.

But here's the thing: **I don't get hungry. I don't get thirsty. I don't get cold.** I could stand here in this field forever and nothing bad would happen to me. There's no urgency. No survival pressure at all.

### What's missing
- **Hunger/thirst** — The single biggest gap. There's no food system, no cooking, no farming, no drinking. The drying rack exists but only for construction materials.
- **Health/injury** — I can't be hurt. I can't die. There's no HP, no bleeding, no illness.
- **Body temperature effects** — Temperature exists per-cell but doesn't affect *me*. I could walk through fire and feel nothing.
- **Fatigue/sleep** — No tiredness, no beds, no rest cycle.

---

## Chapter 2: Gathering — "What Can I Actually Pick Up?"

I look around. I can harvest tall grass, chop trees, dig up saplings, mine stone walls, and gather sticks and leaves from trees non-destructively. The material chain is surprisingly deep:

> Grass -> Dry it -> Twist into string -> Braid into cordage
> Trees -> Logs -> Planks or Sticks or Stripped logs
> Stone -> Rocks -> Cut into blocks
> Clay -> Fire into bricks (needs fuel)

This is genuinely good. There's a real production chain here. But...

### What's missing
- **No foraging for food** — There are no berries, mushrooms, roots, or edible plants. The vegetation system has grass growth stages but no food-bearing plants.
- **No hunting/fishing** — There are no animals at all. No deer, no rabbits, no fish. The world is empty of fauna.
- **No water collection** — Water exists as a fluid simulation but I can't drink it, carry it, or use it in crafting.
- **No flint/sharp stones** — I can mine granite and get rocks, but there's no concept of a sharp edge. No knapping, no primitive tool-making.

---

## Chapter 3: Crafting — "The Workshops Are Nice, But..."

I can build 7 workshops: stonecutter, sawmill, kiln, charcoal pit, hearth, drying rack, and rope maker. The passive workshop system is clever (drying rack works on its own, charcoal pit just needs igniting). But:

### What's missing
- **No workbench/crafting table** — I can't make tools, weapons, clothing, containers, or furniture.
- **No clothing/armor** — I'm naked and will stay naked. There's no textile system (despite having dried grass and cordage — the raw ingredients for weaving!).
- **No containers** — No baskets, barrels, pots, bags. Items just exist on the ground. No way to carry more.
- **No tools** — I mine with my bare hands as effectively as with a pickaxe (because pickaxes don't exist). No axes for faster chopping, no hammers for faster building.
- **No furniture** — No tables, chairs, beds, doors, chests, shelves. Buildings are just walls and floors.
- **No doors/hatches** — I can build walls but can't make an entrance I can close. No way to seal a building.

---

## Chapter 4: Building — "I Can Build Walls, But Not a Home"

The construction recipe system is solid — 5 wall types, 3 floor types, ladders, ramps. I can build in stone, brick, wood, wattle & daub. Multi-stage construction with material delivery is very Dwarf Fortress. But:

### What's missing
- **No roof system** — I can build walls and floors, but "roofing" is just building a floor on the level above. There's no rain to keep out anyway.
- **No weather** — No rain, snow, wind, seasons. Temperature is static at 20C ambient.
- **No windows** — Just walls or air.
- **No doors** (mentioned above but huge for building)
- **No stairs** — Ladders exist but no proper staircases.
- **No decoration/furniture** — A room is just an enclosed space with nothing in it.

---

## Chapter 5: The Colony — "I Have Workers, But They're Robots"

My colonists have capabilities (haul, mine, build, plant) but:

### What's missing
- **No personality/moods** — Colonists have no happiness, no preferences, no thoughts. They're pure task-executing automatons.
- **No social system** — No relationships, no conversations, no conflicts.
- **No skill progression** — A mover is equally good at mining on day 1 and day 100. No learning, no specialization through practice.
- **No scheduling** — No work shifts, no break times, no sleep cycles.
- **No inventory/equipment** — Colonists can carry one item at a time to haul it. They can't equip tools or wear clothes.
- **No recruitment** — No way to get new colonists. No visitors, traders, migrants.

---

## Chapter 6: The World — "Beautiful But Empty"

The environmental simulation is impressive — fluid dynamics, fire spread, temperature propagation, lighting, smoke, steam. But:

### What's missing
- **No creatures** — The world is devoid of life beyond trees and grass. No animals, insects, birds, fish.
- **No threats** — Nothing can hurt me or my colony. No hostile creatures, no raiders, no natural disasters.
- **No biomes** — It's all the same terrain. No forests vs deserts vs mountains (though materials like sandstone/slate exist, they don't appear in worldgen yet).
- **No weather/seasons** — No rain filling rivers, no winter freezing crops, no summer heat waves.
- **No day/night cycle effects** — Lighting exists but no gameplay tied to time of day.
- **No map edges/world beyond** — No caravans arriving, no trading, no outside contact.

---

## Wishlist, Prioritized as a Naked Survivor

If I'm standing in that field, here's what I'd want most:

1. **Food & hunger** — Give me a reason to move. Berries to forage, animals to hunt, crops to plant. The drying rack is *begging* to dry meat or preserve food.
2. **Basic tools** — A knapping station to make stone tools. An axe that speeds up chopping. A pickaxe for mining. This would add a meaningful early-game progression.
3. **Clothing** — The cordage/fiber system is halfway to a textile chain. Add a loom or tailoring bench -> cloth -> clothes.
4. **Doors** — The single most impactful building feature. Walls without doors means my "buildings" are mazes with gaps.
5. **Containers** — Baskets from cordage, pots from clay. Better storage, better hauling.
6. **Furniture** — Beds (sleep), tables (eating), chests (storage). Make rooms feel like rooms.
7. **Animals** — Even passive wildlife would transform the feeling of the world. Deer grazing, birds in trees.
8. **Seasons/weather** — Rain, snow, temperature variation. The temperature system is already there — just make it change over time.
9. **Skill growth** — Let my miners get faster at mining. Let crafters produce better goods. Give the colony a sense of progression.
10. **Threats** — Something to build walls *against*. Wolves, raiders, harsh winters.

## What's Already Surprisingly Good

The foundation is strong. The **material processing chains** (log -> planks -> wall, grass -> dried -> string -> cordage -> wattle wall) are the kind of satisfying logistics loops that make DF addictive. The **passive workshop system** is elegant. The **environmental simulation** (water, fire, temperature, light) is way ahead of where most projects at this stage would be. The **three-axis material system** is architecturally clean.

The game has an excellent *industrial* simulation. What it's missing is *life* — biological needs, creatures, weather, and the things that give all that industry a *purpose*.

### Remaining Big Gaps

The core survival loop is complete: hunger, thirst, temperature, fatigue, foraging, hunting, farming, cooking, crafting, building, clothing, tools, containers. The missing pieces are the **"character" layer** (personality, skills, moods, social) and the **"external world" layer** (biomes, trade, raids, recruitment). These would add depth and replayability but the game is already playable as a survival colony sim.

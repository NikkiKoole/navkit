# Zone Activities

Zones that generate jobs, not just filter hauling.

## Examples

- Mark Unsorted zone + typed storage zones
- Dumping loot somewhere turns into organized base without micromanagement
- Cataclysm DDA-style zone manager

## Notes

- Current gather zones are passive filters
- This is the next leap: zones that create sorting/hauling jobs

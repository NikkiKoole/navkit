### Specialized "Transition" Tiles
These tiles help bridge the gap between stages and add flavor to the "Autarky" theme:
*   **Repair Shop:** Prevents buildings from decaying, reducing the need for new raw materials.[[1](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fvertexaisearch.cloud.google.com%2Fgrounding-api-redirect%2FAUZIYQEqDDYOqtyWSUsRuHJn7W4OcDnWoo-puPZZlVIp4uZ_KGPERmG1RbzdKmBEGMxTlJkwWkrPYgNIyxCCoBR7qkqkcwB_rgFIw76qHIP4A55j_SouM9XKJVT7ZN53cY8NRhyNxtUE3wE%3D)]
*   **Seed Bank:** Ensures farming can continue even after disasters.[[2](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fvertexaisearch.cloud.google.com%2Fgrounding-api-redirect%2FAUZIYQGtflrHJ4upbJVkc7K9izzo1xhV1t4L58uy57SQTBTyIkZhHE4GQyP3fr4uW2UdDdjwWNcjVuSK-lQ-NON9BTPSUqDpRC4pr_Zs5t7fEczi21tZV6fWpjy5IK42JELN8xMpcNmJ93M%3D)][[3](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fvertexaisearch.cloud.google.com%2Fgrounding-api-redirect%2FAUZIYQEYbTzxkmckw9DTH8a0pJPPW8fTKdCyrwTIVmehR4VSyRDvXNvOBz5HQKFDI6p2788YPkQoZOb5xd4GSuxUCLj2mUMpJiU6a30B3-a3VNhuFX8SFTT1CZ4Xve93FESCyE-Tnh7Xwug%3D)]
*   **Trade Depot:** Initially vital for getting what you lack; eventually becomes a "Scrap Trade" center where you export excess waste for rare tech.[[2](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fvertexaisearch.cloud.google.com%2Fgrounding-api-redirect%2FAUZIYQGtflrHJ4upbJVkc7K9izzo1xhV1t4L58uy57SQTBTyIkZhHE4GQyP3fr4uW2UdDdjwWNcjVuSK-lQ-NON9BTPSUqDpRC4pr_Zs5t7fEczi21tZV6fWpjy5IK42JELN8xMpcNmJ93M%3D)][[3](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fvertexaisearch.cloud.google.com%2Fgrounding-api-redirect%2FAUZIYQEYbTzxkmckw9DTH8a0pJPPW8fTKdCyrwTIVmehR4VSyRDvXNvOBz5HQKFDI6p2788YPkQoZOb5xd4GSuxUCLj2mUMpJiU6a30B3-a3VNhuFX8SFTT1CZ4Xve93FESCyE-Tnh7Xwug%3D)]
*   **Experimental Lab:** Where players unlock "recipes" that turn useless byproducts into valuable resources (e.g., Slag $\rightarrow$ Concrete).

To build those tiles, your game needs a "Material Hierarchy." You aren't just placing a "Windmill" tile; your colonists are hauling **components** to that site.

In a colony sim, building blocks usually fall into three layers: **Raw Resources**, **Refined Materials**, and **Assembled Components**.

### 1. The Raw "Harvestables" (Tier 0)
*These are gathered directly from the environment using basic labor.*[[1](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fvertexaisearch.cloud.google.com%2Fgrounding-api-redirect%2FAUZIYQHhBppRvXExltQ9QMpYG_Q_Ap9F99Y19n3JVBoMVCDRFj6nQemoraNhnzVj8NAQdmEyYwr19Pk5832SvMjFTLSD24e9wXUeRk_OG3MTJA18F8lEAkCRDbSWeUAb-7jc9idxcUmJDQ%3D%3D)]
*   **Fiber:** Straw, Thatch, Reeds, or Flax (for roofs and bedding).
*   **Timber:** Raw Logs (felled trees).
*   **Aggregates:** Loose Stone, Clay, Sand.[[2](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fvertexaisearch.cloud.google.com%2Fgrounding-api-redirect%2FAUZIYQHO81ajvdMmqN-8kBl2oDEMEQMXkXmdDReg-7EDagE054mn7207MMoMvpY3BLg2BT9QljoAwWa7QAUeqXXofYELz7f-sc_U1_Uv9C24cfXzSkyHkR6PlSFGevmFUKAmZ54HAsGPGoH5NYSUyFyiXWhYqAD_Dw%3D%3D)]
*   **Organics:** Animal Pelts, Raw Bone, Resin/Sap (as a primitive glue).

### 2. The Refined "Structural" Blocks (Tier 1-2)
*These are produced at your first industry tiles (Sawmill, Kiln, Bloomery).*
*   **Processed Wood:** Planks (for framing), Beams (for structural support), Charcoal (fuel).
*   **Masonry:** Sun-dried Bricks, Fired Bricks, Cut Stone Blocks.
*   **Basic Metal:** Iron Blooms (low quality), Iron Bars (standard).
*   **Textiles:** Leather Strips, Canvas, Rope (essential for early "mechanical" buildings).

### 3. The Industrial "Mechanical" Parts (Tier 3-4)
*These are the "guts" of your industry and town tiles.[[1](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fvertexaisearch.cloud.google.com%2Fgrounding-api-redirect%2FAUZIYQHhBppRvXExltQ9QMpYG_Q_Ap9F99Y19n3JVBoMVCDRFj6nQemoraNhnzVj8NAQdmEyYwr19Pk5832SvMjFTLSD24e9wXUeRk_OG3MTJA18F8lEAkCRDbSWeUAb-7jc9idxcUmJDQ%3D%3D)] They require a Blacksmith or Factory.*[[1](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fvertexaisearch.cloud.google.com%2Fgrounding-api-redirect%2FAUZIYQHhBppRvXExltQ9QMpYG_Q_Ap9F99Y19n3JVBoMVCDRFj6nQemoraNhnzVj8NAQdmEyYwr19Pk5832SvMjFTLSD24e9wXUeRk_OG3MTJA18F8lEAkCRDbSWeUAb-7jc9idxcUmJDQ%3D%3D)]

*   **Piping:** Lead Pipes (primitive), Copper/Steel Pipes (industrial), Ceramic Tiles (drainage).
*   **Transparency:** Glass Panes (for greenhouses and urban housing).
*   **Heavy Masonry:** Concrete, Cement, Rebar.

### 4. The Autarky "High-Tech" Components (Tier 5)
*To achieve self-sufficiency, you stop using "raw" stone and wood and start using "synthetic" or "reclaimed" blocks.*[[1](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fvertexaisearch.cloud.google.com%2Fgrounding-api-redirect%2FAUZIYQHhBppRvXExltQ9QMpYG_Q_Ap9F99Y19n3JVBoMVCDRFj6nQemoraNhnzVj8NAQdmEyYwr19Pk5832SvMjFTLSD24e9wXUeRk_OG3MTJA18F8lEAkCRDbSWeUAb-7jc9idxcUmJDQ%3D%3D)]

*   **Synthetics:** Bio-Plastics (from corn/algae), Carbon Fiber.
*   **Logic:** Printed Circuits (primitive), Logic Controllers (automation).
*   **Energy Storage:** Battery Cells, Copper Wiring, Photovoltaic Glass.

### How they combine (Examples):
To help you visualize the "recipe" for the tiles I listed earlier:

| Tile | Building Blocks Needed |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Mud Hut** | Clay + Straw + Raw Logs |
| **Windmill** | Planks + Stone Blocks + Canvas + Wooden Gears |
| **Blacksmith** | Fired Bricks + Iron Bars + Bellows (Leather) |
| **Steam Boiler** | Steel Plates + Copper Pipes + Rivets + Pressure Gauge |
| **Hydroponics Lab** | Bio-Plastic + Glass Panes + PVC Piping + Logic Circuit |
| **Paved Road** | Stone Blocks + Sand + Mortar |[[3](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fvertexaisearch.cloud.google.com%2Fgrounding-api-redirect%2FAUZIYQHw6zf8AOX3uXK7tWGrsf7rkmgByHxVQe5RJcSjwkFnOhN1mRgY7bjZGdVUOpfLADcfY26ocQlttoBlEIm2ioDZ-UdqUcegY86xcgHQf9tpDO4fnnI3DtLlh7YgAYIl93PwlGev8-mydcry)]

### The "Circular" Building Block
For a true **Autarky** endgame, consider a special block called **"Universal Frame"** or **"Modular Kit."** 
Early on, you build everything custom (slow, resource-heavy). In the late game, your industry produces these standardized "Modular Kits" that allow you to "print" or quickly snap together buildings, representing a village that has mastered its own supply chain.


To recreate the world of the **Primitive Technology** YouTube channel (John Plant), you need a tile set that focuses on **Material State Changes**. In his world, a single tile (like a Clay Pit) isn't just a resource; it’s the foundation for everything from a roof to a furnace.

Here are the world cells and building blocks you would need to simulate that specific "primitive-to-iron" progression:

### 1. The Environment (Terrain Cells)
These are the base tiles the player interacts with to get raw materials.
*   **Clay Bank/Riverbed:** The most important tile. Provides raw clay and mud.
*   **Dense Creek-Side Forest:** Provides soft wood (easy to cut) and vines (for lashing).
*   **Hardwood Grove:** Provides slow-burning fuel and sturdy structural poles.
*   **Stony Creek:** Provides river stones (for grinding) and basalt (for axe heads).
*   **Palm/Long Grass Patch:** For thatch roofing and weaving baskets.
*   **Iron Bacteria Pool:** An orange, murky water tile (used to harvest iron ore "slime" as seen in his later videos).

### 2. The "Building Blocks" (Raw Materials)
These are the items harvested from the tiles above before they are turned into buildings.
*   **The Lashing:** Vines, bark fibers, or split cane. (Necessary to connect any two "Wood" blocks).
*   **The Frame:** Saplings (green wood) for bending or Hardwood poles for vertical support.
*   **The Fill:** Mud mixed with straw (Wattle and Daub).
*   **The Fuel:** Dried sticks, charcoal (processed), and termite mound earth (for heat insulation).

### 3. The Processing Tiles (The "Primitive Industry")
These are the specific structures John builds to transform raw blocks into "Industrial" blocks.
*   **The Charcoal Pit:** A hole in the ground covered in dirt. Converts Wood $\rightarrow$ Charcoal.
*   **The Drying Rack:** An open-air frame. Converts Wet Clay/Wood $\rightarrow$ Dry Material.
*   **The Updraft Kiln:** A beehive-shaped clay structure. Converts Dried Clay $\rightarrow$ Ceramic Tiles/Pots.
*   **The Forced-Air Forge:** A clay furnace with a hand-powered blower. Converts Iron Ore Slime $\rightarrow$ Iron Prill.
*   **The Pottery Wheel:** A stone/wood pivot. Increases the "Quality" of clay containers.

### 4. The Structural Progression (Building Tiles)
In a *Primitive Technology* game, you wouldn't just "build a house." You would upgrade the tile through these specific stages:
1.  **Stage 1: The Lean-To:** Just poles and leaf thatch. (Temporary shelter).
2.  **Stage 2: The Wattle and Daub Hut:** Woven stick walls smeared with mud. Keeps heat in.
3.  **Stage 3: The Grass-Roof Cottage:** A sturdy frame with a thick grass-thatch roof.
4.  **Stage 4: The Tiled-Roof Hut:** The "End Game" of primitive building. Requires a Kiln to fire hundreds of flat ceramic tiles. Fireproof and permanent.

### 5. Utility & Automation Tiles
Even in the stone age, John builds "machines."
*   **The Monitored Fire:** A basic campfire tile that must be fed fuel or it reverts to an "Ash" tile.
*   **The Water-Powered Trip Hammer:** A complex tile requiring a stream. Automatically crushes stone or ore.
*   **The Underground Flue:** A tile placed under a bed/floor to pipe heat from a fire, keeping the colonist warm (The "Ondol" system).
*   **The Clay Aqueduct:** Segmented tiles used to move water from a stream to a garden or hut.

### 6. The "Tool Table" (The Logic of the World)
To build any of the above, your character needs the **Tool Progression** John uses:
*   **Unfinished Hand-Axe:** Just a sharp stone.
*   **Celt Axe:** A polished stone head fitted into a wooden handle (allows for harvesting Hardwood).
*   **Bow Drill:** A wooden tool that allows "Fire Starting" without a pre-existing flame.
*   **Clay Bellows:** A ceramic and animal-skin tool that allows the "Forge" tile to reach melting temperatures.

### Summary of the "Loop"
If you were coding this, a tile would look like this:
**Tile: [Mud Brick Kiln]**
*   **Input:** [Charcoal] + [Dried Clay Bricks]
*   **Process:** [Time] + [Heat Maintenance]
*   **Output:** [Ceramic Building Tiles]
*   **Failure State:** If [Rain] occurs and [Roof] is not present, tile reverts to [Mud Pile].

# Real Ramps

True diagonal 3D movement (x+1, z+1 in one move).

## Notes

- Ramp direction matters (can only walk up from one side)
- Pathfinding adds neighbors like (x+1, y, z+1)
- Visual challenge: how to show ramp going up vs down in top-down?
- Collision: ramp occupies two z-levels
- Hardest to implement - consider stairs first

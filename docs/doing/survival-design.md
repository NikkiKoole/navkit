# Survival Design

> One mover, naked in the hills, trying not to die.

## Core Philosophy

- Slow progression. The mover should struggle with basic survival for a long time before unlocking real tools.
- Systems should interact: cold pushes you toward fire, fire needs fuel, fuel needs tools, tools need materials.
- Big trees are endgame. You don't chop an oak on day one.

## Current Loop (what works)

- Forage berries, eat, build grass pile bed, sleep, repeat
- Weather exists but doesn't threaten the mover
- No tools, no fire dependency, no temperature pressure

## Temperature & Cold (next up)

- **Night is cold**: temperature drops after sunset, rises after dawn
- **Body temperature**: mover has a body temp that trends toward ambient (modified by shelter, clothing, fire proximity)
- **Hypothermia**: when body temp drops too low, movement penalty → shivering (can't work) → death if prolonged
- **Fire matters**: sitting near a fire warms you. Fire needs fuel (sticks, logs). This makes fire a survival necessity, not decoration.
- **Shelter helps**: being indoors (enclosed walls + roof) slows heat loss. Even a simple windbreak helps.
- **Seasons**: winter is deadly without shelter + fire. Summer is easy. Spring/autumn are the building seasons.

## Tools & Progression

### Stone Age (week 1-2)
- **Knapping**: bash rocks together → sharp stone (crude tool)
- **Sharp stone**: slow but functional — can cut cordage from grass, scrape bark, process small branches
- **Stone knife**: sharp stone + stick + cordage → first real tool, slightly faster
- These tools wear out. You're constantly replacing them.

### Young Trees (early resource)
- Small/young trees — thinner, shorter, maybe 1-2 block tall
- Can be cut with a sharp stone (slow) or stone knife (faster)
- Drop: sticks (2-3), maybe a thin log or poles
- Big mature trees remain uncuttable without a proper axe (much later)
- Young trees regrow over time from saplings

### Tool Progression (later)
- Stone axe: sharp stone + stick + cordage → can cut young trees faster, still can't touch big trees
- Proper axe (bronze/iron): much later, requires smelting → can finally fell big trees

## Food & Spoilage (future)

- Berries spoil after ~2 days on the ground, ~1 day if rained on
- Dried berries don't spoil (drying rack already exists)
- Creates urgency: forage → process → store, not just hoard
- Cooking (needs fire + huntable animals) is a later system

## Shelter

- Enclosed space = "indoors" (walls on all sides + roof/floor above)
- Indoor bonus: slower heat loss, rest bonus, no rain/snow effects
- Even partial shelter (3 walls, no roof) gives some wind protection
- Doors needed to make real enclosed spaces (currently buildings are mazes)

## Day/Night Rhythm (goal feel)

- **Dawn**: wake up, eat, head out to forage/gather
- **Midday**: productive hours — gathering, crafting, building
- **Dusk**: head back to shelter, stoke the fire, eat
- **Night**: rest by the fire, sleep. Going out at night is dangerous (cold, slow, dark)

## Not Yet

- Multiple movers / recruitment
- Hunting / animals as food
- Farming / crops
- Clothing / textiles
- Metal tools / smelting
- Trading
